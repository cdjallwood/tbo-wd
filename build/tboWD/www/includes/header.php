<p>Before you can do the work, you have to win the work. If you are coming from a designer / developer background rather than sales, this can seem like an impossible task.</p>

<p>The learning curve for sales can be the steepest and most daunting of all. Having learnt a lot through trial and error, Kirsty will attempt to give some useful tips on how to convince potential clients that you are the best person for the job without resorting to bribery and corruption. Its all about remembering to smile!</p>

<p>Of course there are some meetings that no amount of smiling can save, and so, for your learning pleasure (or amusement depending on how you look at it) I will share some of those moments that just can't happen to anyone else! </p>

<p>Oh, and there will be kittens. Possibly even kittens and Star Wars! ~ grin!</p>

<p>Many designers and developers do not have business backgrounds, and MBAs, yet setup agencies
because we love the thrill of design and want to make a difference. There are many thriving small studios
but often, we find ourselves challenged by leading teams, running sales departments, propelling marketing,
managing processes and doing web design all at the same time. So how can we grow our agencies from
singular clients and 1-2 staff to international stardom? Also does a yearly business plan make a difference
and when is the right time to create one? Danny will explain how better processes and recurring
procedures increase revenue, reduce risk, improve profitability, transform HR and lead to better client
relationships. He will explain how strategic R&D, innovation and a passion for usability are key to success.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges of running a web design business is working with clients. Get it wrong and you will either find yourself in constant conflict with clients or being reduced to a pixel pusher. Get it right and you will escape the world of endless iterations and micro-managing clients. Your clients will be happier and most of all your business will become more profitable.</p>

<p>In his talk Paul will explain how educating clients is essential to getting sign-off. Among other lessons you will learn to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Be seen by clients as the expert</li>
	<li>Manage negative feedback</li>
	<li>Handle difficult people</li>
	<li>Change the relationship with your clients</li>
