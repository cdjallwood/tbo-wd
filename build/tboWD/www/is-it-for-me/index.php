					<h2>Why attend 'The Business of Web Design'?</h2>

<p>Many web conferences (including my dear own <a href="http://port80events.co.uk">Port80</a>) are very web technology focussed. And that makes perfect sense, we're in an incredibly fast moving industry and getting together, learning about the latest techniques is really, really important. But there is more to running a successful web business than just smart techology.</p>

<p>I fell into running my own company as I didn't really enjoy working for other people, I wanted to be my own boss and to be able to make the right decisions for me, my family and my clients.</p>

<p>It certainly was not easy as first, I had a love of the web but zero clue when it came to running a business. I knew nothing about getting clients, pricing work, estimating, contracts etc. All of those essential things which you need to run a smooth ship. The sad thing is that if you get these things wrong, the stress will mount and your passion for work will quickly evaporate. </p>

<p>In short I wanted to put on a conference which would have helped the me of 7 years ago. A conference which would have made me think harder about running a business (not a hobby shop) and, hopefully saved me from making some painful (and sometimes expensive) mistakes. I also wanted to put a conference where I could carry on that learning and become better andbetter at the business side of things; hence The Business of Web Design.</p>

<h2>So, who is this conference for?</h2>

<h3>1) You're a web freelancer</h3>
<p>Perhaps you're a remote designer or developer. Perhaps you work onsite with clients. Either way you know you want to up your game on the business side. Perhaps you've had your fingers burnt on a project which went wrong and you want to avoid more of the same.</p>

<h3>2) You run a small web agency</h3>
<p>You employ a few people (either permanent or freelance) and you've noticed the growing pains. As you know, running a business is a 24x7 thing and being open to new ideas (or a reminder of what you <em>should</em> be doing) is all par for the course.</p>

<h3>3) You're thinking about freelancing </h3>
<p>What better way to find out about running your own show! You'll been listening and chatting to loads of like minded people and some really great speakers. Come along, learn, network, enjoy.</p>


<p>So, that's what I think the deal is. My aim is that you walk away from the day brimming with ideas for how to take your business forward. We won't be able to cover <em>every</em> aspect of business; there's just not enough time (although I'm sure the Q&amp;A session at the end will generate a lot of talk!). But if you're able to spend a day away from your work; and to concentrate on your business, perhaps that's the best investment you can make in 2014.</p>
